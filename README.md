# VisitorBooking
mobile based visitor registration

This is a small individual hackathon competition we are doing at school.

Project Specification:
======================

Most offices still use Visitors books at reception. All people who arrive at the company offices are required to sign in. In the trending world of apps, Create an Android app to be used in a tablet device or a phone device. 
The visitors’ book at reception will be replaced by the app in a mobile device.
The app should allow the users (as in the visitor) to do the following:
•	Allow the user to enter their
	 Name, 
	contact , 
	person to visit and
	 reason to visit.
BY entering the above details, the user will be saved in the app and they don’t need a pen to sign on paper.
•	The app should save all entries of each day in one file. The file should be named the date of that day.
•	Each day should have a separate file.
•	The app should have the option of showing the visitors who have come to the office for the day. The visitors should be listed with a number showing the order in which they arrived at the office. Data should be displayed in rows for each visitor.

Feel free to design what you like. Make sure that all the above features are included in your app and they are working.
